I'm a Ph.D. student from Computer Science Department, University of Minnesota, advised by [Volkan Isler](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~isler/), from Robotics Sensor Networks ([RSN](https://rsn.umn.edu/)) Lab. 
Previously I graduated from Mechanical Engineering Department, Tsinghua University.

My general research area focus on the perception-oriented robot motion/view planning, using the tools such as generative models, reinforcement learning, etc.
More specifically I solve human-involved robotics problem, such as following a human in the front with a robot, by predicting it's motion/poses, or planning views for 3D reconstruct a dynamic human in high fidelity, etc.
Please refer to the projects below.

Research on robotics is one important part of my life, but is not all. 
I'm also an amateur athlete, a gamer, a volunteer and perhaps a vlogger.
For each role, I tried to be the best of myself. 
In my personal website, I also want to share my other sides of the life journey, my thoughts and my stories.
If I have the fortunate to share one part of my life with you, I'm very happy, and I'm very grateful for that.
