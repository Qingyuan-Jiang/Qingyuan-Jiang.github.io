I'm a Ph.D. student from Computer Science Department, University of Minnesota, advised by [Volkan Isler](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~isler/). Previously I graduated from Mechanical Engineering Department, Tsinghua University.

My general research area focus on the perception-oriented robot motion/view planning, using the tools such as generative models, reinforcement learning, etc.
