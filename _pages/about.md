I'm a Ph.D. student from the Computer Science Department, University of Minnesota, advised by [Volkan Isler](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~isler/), from Robotics Sensor Networks ([RSN](https://rsn.umn.edu/)) Lab. 
Previously, I got my B.S. in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Tsinghua University.

My general research focuses on perception-oriented robot motion/view planning, using tools such as generative models, reinforcement learning, etc.
More specifically, my current projects solve human-involved robotics problems, such as following a human in the front with a robot by predicting its motion/poses or planning views for 3D reconstruction of a dynamic human in high fidelity, etc.
Feel free to check out my [publications](/publications) or my listed [projects](/projects) for more details.

Besides robotics research, I'm also an amateur athlete and a gamer.
I also spent time doing volunteer work and documenting my life using photos and videos.
For each role, I tried to be the best of myself. 
On my personal website, I also want to share my other sides of the life journey, my thoughts, and my stories.
