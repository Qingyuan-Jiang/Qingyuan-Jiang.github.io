abstract="This paper proposes a novel parallel pinching and self-adaptive grasping hand with triple-shaft pulley-belt mechanisms, named TPM hand. It contains two TPM fingers, and each finger has two phalanges, and mainly consists of a driving shaft, triple pulleys, two belts, and two springs. The TPM hand is capable of grasping objects with parallel pinching and enveloping, and simultaneously adapting to the contours of the objects. Particularly, compared with other parallel pinching and self-adaptive grasping hands, the TPM hand separates the proximal shaft and the driving shaft so that the grasping range can be expanded. Besides, due to the elasticity of flexible devices, objects can be protected in emergencies. New mechanical parameters are added and are conformed to specific domain and function. This function is given in this paper through geometry model. Meanwhile, a feasible analysis is provided to discuss the influence of parameters brought by the departure above. Also, the process of grasping is discussed, and the kinematic analysis is provided.",
